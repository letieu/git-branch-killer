# Git Branch Deletion Script

This script (`remove.mjs`) helps you delete Git branches locally or remotely. Before using the script, please ensure that you have `zx` installed globally on your system.

## Prerequisites

- **zx**: Install `zx` globally using the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install -g zx
   ```

## How to Use

1. Clone the Git repository or download the script (`remove.mjs`) to your local system.

2. Run the script using `zx` in your repository's root directory. For example:

   ```bash
   cd my-project
   zx /path/to/script/remove.mjs
   ```

## Options

The script supports the following options:

- `--remote`: Use this flag to delete remote branches instead of local branches. For example:

  ```bash
  zx /path/to/script/remove.mjs --remote
  ```

- `--exclude`: You can exclude specific branches from deletion, by default the script will not delete the `main, master, develop, development, and test` branches. For example:

  ```bash
  zx /path/to/script/remove.mjs --exclude=feature-x,bugfix-y
  ```

## Important Notes

- Certain branches (`main`, `master`, `develop`, `development`, and `test`) are considered permanent and will not be deleted to prevent accidental removal of important branches.

- Attempting to delete the `main` branch will result in an error message, and the script will terminate to protect against accidental deletion.

Feel free to use and modify this script to suit your specific requirements. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please create an issue or submit a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/your-repo-url).

Happy branching and coding! ðŸ˜„
